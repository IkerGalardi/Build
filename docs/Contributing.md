# Contributing

Commits must follow the next convention:
```
  topic: short message

  Deeper explanation about the changes made. Trivial changes might not need this deepder
  explanation, but the majority of cases probably need a small explanation at least.
```

Where topic is one of the next:

- projman: when the changes refer to the project management code
- makegen: when the changes refer to the makefile generator
- docs: when changes or additions are made to the documentation (README also counts)
- scripts: when changes or additions are made to helper scripts
- misc: whatever does not fit in the other categories
